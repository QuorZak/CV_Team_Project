# CalibPointsH3image.xlsx provides the coordinates for the image captured by H3

# CalibPointsW3image.xlsx provides the coordinates for the image captured by W3

# Each xlsx file has seven columns as X, Y, Z, u, v, u', v'

	# (X, Y, Z) are the 3D coordinate of the corner in world refrence frame (you do not need them for the distortion)
	# (u, v) is the 2D coordinate of the corner in the distorted image (this is indeed (xd, yd))
	# (u',v') is the 2D coordinate of the corner in the undistorted image (this is indeed (xu, yu))


# The xlsx coordinates can also be computed by Get3d2dCoordniates.py file. The parameter settings can be found the provided json file.

# FYI: In the json file.
	#  square_size is the size of chessboard squares in cm
	#  rows is the number of rows in the chessboard pattern
	#  column is the number of columns in the chessboard pattern 
	#  left_offset is the distance from the first column of corners in the left plane to the centeral axis 
	#  right_offset is the distance from the first column of corners in the right plane to the centeral axis
	#  left_offset and right_offset are in cm
		#  These parameters are used to generate the 3D corner coordinates (X, Y, Z) in the world refrence frame, which is necessary for the calibration step
	#  H3_pixel_size_x and H3_pixel_size_y show the pixel size in cm for H3 camera
	#  W3_pixel_size_x, W3_pixel_size_y show the pixel size in cm for W3 camera


# Note: FOR THE DISTORTION (Phase-1)
# You need to work on (u, v) coordinates and compute the undistorted coordinates close to (u', v')
# We have provided (u', v') coordinates as references. You only need to work on (u, v) coordinates for RANSAC and computing the best Kappa
# To load (u,v) coordinates, you can read from xlsx files OR use Get3d2dCoordniates.py with the parameters provided in the JSON file
# In utilities.py there is a function named NearestNeighbourInterpolation, which could be used once you compute the kappa value. 
  This function implements the warping step that you need to apply kappa on the whole image


# Note: FOR THE CALIBRATION (Phase-2)
  You also have access all the data needed for the calibration in the current zip file. 
  The input image for the calibration step MUST be the output of the distortion phase (the undistorted image)
