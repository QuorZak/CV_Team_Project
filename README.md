Tihs repository contains work for the CompSci 773 2023 practical assignment on image stitching and camera calibration. 

Note: For this project, if we made heavy use of higher level OpenCV functions, this would have lead to lower marks. The course wanted us to implement
 the necessary steps of the algorithms on our own (without having to reinvent convolutions).

Practice: Used a virtual environment for developing. This way one could use dependencies like matplotlib or numpy in a
clean environment dedicated to this assignment. 

Here is a link to a file giving some hints and tips regarding developing and the use of numpy:
